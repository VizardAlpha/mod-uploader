# App Icon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the app icon. 

To use a real icon:
1. Replace this file with an actual icon file named "app-icon.png" for the JavaFX application
2. Replace this file with an actual icon file named "app-icon.ico" for the Windows executable

The icon should be a square image, preferably 256x256 pixels or larger.
